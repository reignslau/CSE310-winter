# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote.}
The software is a machine learning project in R that predicts car prices using a linear regression model. It loads car sales data, preprocesses it, trains the model, evaluates its performance, and provides visualizations.

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
My purpose for writing this software was to gain hands-on experience in machine learning with R. Specifically, I wanted to learn how to build and evaluate predictive models for car prices using real-world data.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
