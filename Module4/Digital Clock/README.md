# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote.}
As a software engineer aiming to enhance my skills, I developed a digital clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project serves as a practical exercise to strengthen my understanding of web development fundamentals and JavaScript programming.

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
The software I created is a simple digital clock that displays the current time in a 12-hour format with AM/PM indication. It updates the time every second, providing users with an accurate representation of the current time.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
